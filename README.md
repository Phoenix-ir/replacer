## Building from source

### Linux
```
have python 3
```
```
chmod 700 ./repHh.py
```
```
python repHh.py
```
*in the terminal while in the script directory*

### Windows 

if you dont trust the executable just build from source

```
Get python 3.6.8 then
```
```
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```
and after that
```
auto-py-to-exe
```
in cmd and from then on its gui so ez, enjoy!
