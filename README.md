## Building from source

if you dont trust the executable just build from source
*Every os supporting python should work*

```
Get python 3.6.8 then
```
```
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```
```
and after that
```
```
auto-py-to-exe
```
in cmd, or the terminal for linux and from then on its gui so ez, enjoy!
